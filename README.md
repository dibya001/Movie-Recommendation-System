# Movie-Recommendation-System

This project contains predicting unknown movie ratings using traditional collaborative filtering algorithms.

The algorithms implemented in this repo are:
1- Item Based Collaborative Filtering - Prediction based on computing item-item similarity
2- User Based Collaborative Filtering - User-User similarity computation
3- Similarity Fusion - Combining user based and item based collaborative filtering.(In some way) (For more info please refer paper #3)

Datasets used:
1- MovieLens
2- Netflix
3- Yahoo Music


Metrics used:
1- Mean Absoulte Error
2 - Mean Squared Error
3 - Good Item Mean(GIM)
4 - Good Predicted Item Mean(GPIM)
5 - Precision
6 - Recall
